### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about web development.
- ðŸ”­ I was previously employed as a Solutions Engineers in data visualization and API design.
- :floppy_disk: I have experience with javascript, python, django, wagtail, bootstrap, openapi, docker, r & arduino.
- :wrench: Tools I like to use include tableau, stoplight and postman.
- Just living my best life and trying to ship :shipit: the best experiences possible.
- :earth_americas: I love languages!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on javascript or python projects.
- at some point :surfer: I would love to learn more about gatsby.js and getting it hooked up to a headless wagtail CMS for blogging purposes.

I might replace this site with the above mentioned gatsby/wagtail project, this is [my current portfolio.](https://stephenlprice.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/).
